        This class is meant to wrap a shap explainability (https://github.com/slundberg/shap)
        specifically for time series.

        The idea is to get the shap values for each past time step of a given sample for a given
        timeserie prediction. past_steps_explained gives the past horizon we want to explain.

        For now only univariate time series has been implemented.

        Warning

        This is only a shap value of direct influence and doesn't take into account relationships 
        between past values. Hence a past timestep could also have an indirect influence via the 
        intermediate timesteps.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model
            A forecasting model we want to explain.
        n
            number of predictions ahead we want to explain
        past_steps_explain
            A number of timesteps in the past of which we want to estimate the shap values. If x_t is 
            our prediction, past_steps_explain = p will take x_(t-1) ... x_(t-p) features in the past. 
            We will have as a result a matrix of n*past_steps_explain as there are n predictions to explain.
            This number is often linked to the model (order of the AR, input_chunk_length for a torch
            model etc...). For now we keep it generic.
        background_series
            the series we want to use to compare the foreground we want to explain. This is optional,
            for 2 reasons:
                * In general we want to keep the training_series of the model and this is the default one,
                but in case of multiple time series training (global or meta learning) we don't save them. 
                In this case we have to input a background_series.
                * We might want to compare to a reduced background distribution for computing time sake.
